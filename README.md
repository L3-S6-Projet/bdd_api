## How to start the project?
Build scripts are included in the project to run DB migrations and setup a basic super user. You first need to create a python virtual environment for the scripts to work.
The folder containing the virtual environment should be named:
- venv on Windows
- .venv on Linux

Let PyCharm create it on Windows, and if you're on Linux, you should know how to do this anyway ðŸ˜Š

The test user is identified by :
- Username: test
- Password: passwdtest

The scripts should be run before starting the app. Thee following guide will show you how to add the proper script to run before build.
